Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
Data is reviewed by GIS technical Support , STL Data administrator and GIS Metadata Administrator.
Data was reviewed by the GIS Data Administrator and GIS Metadata Administrator.
  
Notes:
On June 2001, a shape file, schl0501.shp, was provided by Jose Gonzalez from the School Board. This shapefile became the new LSCHOOLS coverage. Both files (schl0501.shp and LSCHOOLS) were compared in detail to make sure that previous schools would not be missing from the new LSCHOOLS coverage. Items PRINCIPAL, CONTACT, and PHONE were adopted from the shape file. Item STE_RM was deleted from LSCHOOLS..
ARCEDIT and digital orthophotography was used to move the labels to the exact location, instead of showing the labels on the streets.
  
Originally data was provided by the School Board in a txt format and it was geocoded first to the property layer and those rejected addresses were then geocoded to Dade County Street Network. Periodically this data is updated as per memos from Ms. Marie Jean-Francois, Intelligence Analysis Section, phone 305-471-2752.
  
The phone book was also used, to verify some of the new informaton. Facility type for Charter schools is the combination of school number and location with region number = 7. My Doan also called on the phone and used the web sites to verify information.</supplinf>
