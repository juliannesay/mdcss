            <abstract>A point feature class of Miami-Dade County Operated Fire and Rescue Stations that provide emergency or administrative services to the public. Not every station has rescue services. Some stations have administrative responsibilities. Each station is responsible for a designated area (grids).Updated: Annually The data was created using: Projected Coordinate System: WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_SphereProjection: Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere</abstract>
            <purpose>A point feature class of Miami-Dade County Operated Fire and Rescue Stations that provide emergency or administrative services to the public.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Procedures_Used:
Address-match data to Property, geocoded rejects to the street centerlines, then align points to property where available.

Revisions:
Date May 2021       By: Josh Brashears
Reason:  Updated address of station 29 to 351 SW 107th Ave, moved the point, and updated associated attributes.

Date April 2020             By: Daniel Alvarez de la Campa
Reason:  Added Station 41 and populated attributes. Changed address for Station 62 to 14251 OLD CUTLER RD.

Date September 2018       By: Josh Brashears
Reason:  Added Station 18.  Made corrections to MUNICID values to match MDC.Municipality_poly (the field is Text with width 2 and the single-digit values needed leading zeroes.)

Date September 2017       By: Josh Brashears
Reason:  Several of the below updates were somehow rolled back or perhaps not completed as described below.  The following 3 fire stations were re-positioned over their correct locations:  62, 40, and 64.  Station 62's point was incorrectly positioned over 7020 SW 144TH ST and now it is over 7055 SW 144TH ST as per its address.  Fire station 62 was telephoned on 9/20/2017 to confirm they are on the NE corner of Old Cutler Rd and SW 144TH ST in a trailer.  The point for station 40 was incorrectly positioned over 901 SW 62ND AVE and now it is over 975 SW 62ND AVE as per its address.  Fire station 64 needed its address changed from 8205 COMMERCE WAY to 15325 NW 77TH CT and the point moved accordingly (this change is noted below as of April 2016 but must have been rolled back.)  The lat, lon, x, and y were updated manually.  Additionally, many of the NAME values were updated (e.g. Goulds was changed to Princeton, Golden Glades was changed to Norland, etc.  The names now reflect what is written on the front of the fire station).  Station 73 (Fireboat) physically moved to 903 S AMERICA WAY recently so their address was updated and point moved.  Station 41 needed to be deleted - it is no longer a physical fire station.  This division chief (Ops North) is at station 63.

Date June 2017           By: April ROsier
Reason: Moved Station 29 point to 10610 W Flagler St. Updated X, Y, LAT, and LONG at for that point.  

Date January 2017       By: April Rosier
Reason: Added new point for station Palmetto Bay North, 7055 SW 144TH ST and populated attributes.

Date January 2017       By: April Rosier
Reason: Added new point for station 70 Coconut Palm, 11451 SW 248TH ST and populated attributes.

Date April 2016                         By: Diana Zalivchaya
Reason: Points for stations 9, 14, 15, 21, 24, 32, 34, 40, 51, 53, 54, 57, 63, 76 were moved to the their correct locations.  Moved station 64 from 8205 COMMERCE WAY to 15325 NW 77TH CT. XY coordinates and Lat Lon were recalculated.

September 2015        By Ivonne Rodriguez
Names have been changed to proper cased and adding the number of the station if they have it  Ex. (Miami Fire Station 13).
Many of the points were located outside of buildings all have been corrected to represent and identify Fire Stations locations within Miami-Dade County. LOT/LAT recalculated.

Date September 2015              By: Victoria Calle
Reason:  Created new point for station 70 Naranja, 11451 SW 248TH ST. Calculated XY and Lat Lon coordinates for that point.

Date April 2015              By: Victoria Calle
Reason:  Moved Station 27 from 7903 EAST DR to 1275 NE 79TH ST and Station 16 from 325 NW 2ND ST to 255 NW 4TH AVE. Recalculated XY and Lat Lon coordinates for that point.

Date August 2014              By: Victoria Calle
Reason:  Moved Golden Glades station from the street to the property and recalculated XY and Lat Lon coordinates for that point.

Date February 2014              By: Josh Brashears
Reason:  Added station 69 and populated attributes.

Date September 2012              By: Josh Brashears
Reason:  Added station 76 and populated attributes.

Date September 2012              By: Alina Herrera/Josh Brashears
Reason:  Updated the TYPE field, NAME field, and several addresses per MDFR. No feature edits were done - only attributes.

Date March 2011              By: Josh Brashears
Reason: Moved station 41 from the street centerline to its location over the actual building.

Date June 2010                By: Josh Brashears
Reason: Annual Hurricane Season update. Added fire stations 78 (Eastern Shores) and 88 (Support).  Also corrected the location of stations 13 (Old Headquarters) and 39 (Port of Miami).

Date March 2008                By: Josh Brashears
Reason: Added fire stations Trail, Highland Oaks, East Homestead, and Village of Homestead, and East Homestead. 7 Fire Stations have not been populated with a folio number since their exact location cannot be found without a physical field check.

Date March 2006                By: Lilliam Vega &amp; Jeffrey Ruiz
Reason: Added fire station FireBoat1.  Jeffrey populated available folios and aligned some stations to the Property.  Stations aligned to the street were could not be identified by from the Property layer or Orthos.

Date: October 2006            By: GIS Technical Support Staff
Reason: The data was converted from the legacy coverage format to the ArcGIS Geodatabase feature class format.

Date: October 2006    By: Josh Brashears
Reason: Moved station 59 into the proper grid and away from the street centerline to result in correct jurisdiction assignment for 911.

Date: May 2006        By: MDFD and Jeffrey Ruiz
Reason: Corrected Station 10 address from 75 NE 172nd st to 175 172nd St. Point is in its correct location.

Date: April 2006      By: Lilliam Vega, Lois Ziemba, Jeff Ruiz
Reason: Annual Hurricane update. Moved station 12 to its correct location at Miami-International Airport.

Date: December 2005   By: Josh Brashears
Reason: 911 user requested an update to the layer. Updated station 25 to reflect its correct address, new location, and changed type.  Added new station 60.

Date: March 2005     By: Josh Brashears/Jeffrey Ruiz
Reason: Made the addresses USPS standard.  Increased the width of the ADDRESS item to 30 so that addresses don't get cut off. Stations 58 and 64 were added as per Clare, station 52 name was corrected to South Miami Heights and station 45 city was changed to Doral by Jeffrey.

Date: August 2004                 By: N. Alvarez
Reason: Add City field as per OEM.

Date: May 2003                    By: N. Alvarez
Reason:  Converted lfirest.shp sent by Lilliam Vega to coverage. West Kendall station 57 was added.

Date: Oct 2002                     By: Lilliam Vega
Reason: Add new fire station 59.

Date: May 2002                     By: Lilliam Vega
Reason: Points were aligned to the property instead of street network due to conflict with traffic signals.  Added West Sunset station, correct station 24 and 54 address, change station 20, 24, 28, 51 and 54 zipcode, change station 12, 13, 25, 44, 45 and 87 type,
corrected the munic code.

Date:  1996                        By:  Lois Ziemba
Revised as new stations are added or as requested by Barbara Matthews of The Fire Department.

Reviews_Applied_to_Data:
Data is reviewed by FIRE for correctness.  Then, by the GIS Data Administrator and GIS Metadata Administrator.

Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:
This layer should be used with LFIREMUN (Municipal Fire Stations) to identify
all Fire and Rescue stations within Miami-Dade County.

Notes:
Stations in this layer are all operated by Miami-Dade County,
Fire and Resue department. Also, points should not be geocoded
to the street network but to property.
